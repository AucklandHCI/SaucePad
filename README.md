# SaucePad
A structured source code editor for Android.

##Installation:
#####1) Developer Options
Ensure that developer options have been enabled on your android device.
On older phones (prior to v4.2), this is at Settings -> Applications -> Development and on newer phones, this can be enabled by pressing on the build number 7 times. Once in "Developer Options" enable "USB Debugging" to allow Android Studio to deploy the app to the phone.

#####2) Usage
To use the application, either swipe in from the left or press the icon with three horizontal bars in the top left corner. This will bring up a drawer for different sections - to be later used for navigation purposes. In the drawer, select "Section 3", which will show an empty editor with options to enter code.
Currently, only the first parameter of a method signature can be entered.
